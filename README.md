# JBKenBurnsView
This project was based on the JBKenBurnsView created by Javier Berlana et. al.

However, I wanted additional functionality like pausing and resuming the image gallery, so the project has deviated a bit from its origin.

The JBKenBurnsView version 1.0 supports:
1. Start Animation using an array of UIImages or paths.
2. Pause / Resume Animation.
3. Stop Animation.
4. The ability to append individual images.
5. The ability to fetch the currently shown image.
6. Check if the animation is currently paused.

The view also deals with device orientation changes. Maybe not in the best possible way, but it works for my needs..
